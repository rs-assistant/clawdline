# Connection health: evidence contract v1

Status: 2026-10-20. The local evidence foundation in `internal/domain/connectionhealth` is
implemented and tested, and the daemon now runs one runtime of it per boot, instruments the relay
transport, the WebSocket writer and the link's lanes, and answers it on a local route and the
`clawdline health` CLI. The durable store keeps the journal across boots, and an opt-in daemon
uploader (§9a) sends its content-free metadata to Cloud's machine ingest over its own HTTPS
client. The query shapes in §9 remain a proposal; Cloud's implemented API is its own
`docs/connection-health-contract.md`. Product scope stays as `docs/admin-connection-health.md` states it
(P0–P3, M01–M06); this page is only the wire and evidence contract under it.

## 1. What exists and what does not

| Part | State | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active-phase table (128 slots, 8 reserved) | implemented | `internal/domain/connectionhealth/active.go` |
| Watchdog (reads atomics and its own clock only; queues transitions to one journal writer) | implemented | `watchdog.go` |
| In-memory journal ring and query page | implemented | `journal.go` |
| Segment truth table, stage progress, local export | implemented | `evidence.go` |
| One runtime per daemon boot (fresh random `boot_id`, build from the binary's commit), watchdog run for the daemon's lifetime, Cloud on or off | implemented; `CLAWDLINE_CONNECTION_HEALTH=off` turns it off | `runtime.go`, `cmd/clawdline/health.go` `startConnectionHealth` |
| Capacity rows `cloud.health_*` | measured from the tracker snapshot, journal occupancy and transition queue; unmeasured with a reason when monitoring is off | `internal/transport/http/capacity_measures_connection_health.go` |
| Daemon call sites | **partial**: see §4.1 for the exact list. One correlation now runs from the transport's frame phase through the relay queue (`Inbound.Correlation`), the lane and handler, the answer's reservation, seal and spool enqueue (the handler's context, `connectionhealth.WithCorrelation`), the spool row (`SpoolRow.Correlation`, local only) and every drain write and reconnect re-send of that row. Answers published outside a handler (status snapshots, terminal frames, carrier answers) are still uncorrelated | `internal/adapters/cloud/transport.go`, `websocket.go`, `spool.go`, `internal/transport/cloud/link.go`, `relay.go` |
| Local route `GET /v1/connection-health/{status,events,trace,export}` and `clawdline health` | implemented, this machine's own token only, refused through Cloud | `internal/transport/http/connection_health.go`, `cmd/clawdline/health.go` |
| Per-build location map | **partial**: every wired location code names its Go function (checked by `runtime.FuncForPC` in the owning package's tests); no file lines | `locations.go` |
| Durable segmented store, boot markers on disk | implemented and opened by the daemon off the startup path; the watchdog's journal writer offers each stamped record (`Watchdog.Attach`); history route and CLI read it. The ring itself is still memory only and says so | `internal/adapters/healthjournal`, `docs/admin-connection-health-storage.md` |
| Stall capture worker (one worker, one in flight, 1 MiB raw buffer kept in memory only, 512 KiB sanitized capture, 2 s budget, 4 a minute) | implemented, on by default; `CLAWDLINE_STALL_CAPTURE=off` turns it off (§4.2) | `internal/domain/connectionhealth/capture.go`, `cmd/clawdline/health.go` |
| Daemon uploader to Cloud ingest (opt-in, own HTTPS client, bounded, durable progress) | implemented, off by default (§9a) | `internal/adapters/healthupload`, `cmd/clawdline/health.go` |
| Shutdown: watchdog and writer stopped, uploader stopped, store flushed and closed within 3 s | implemented on SIGTERM/interrupt | `cmd/clawdline/health.go` `stopConnectionHealthOnSignal` |
| Browser viewer producer (opt-in, own HTTPS upload, bounded) | implemented, off by default; installed only by an explicit `startViewerHealth` call (§11) | `web/console/src/health-viewer`, `web/console/src/legacy/js/net/viewer-health-hook.js` |
| Cloud stored queries in a UI, owner sealing | **not built here** (separate tasks) | — |

Every export carries the same list as `wiring[]` (`evidence.go` `Unwired`), so no reader can take
the foundation for the pipeline.

## 2. Identifiers

All strings the package exports are enums, location codes or opaque ids. There is no free-text
field. Validation is at the door (`Tracker.Begin`, `Journal.Append`, `NewJournal`) and a refusal
names the field, never its value. `Journal.Append` checks each field against its own rule —
`event`, `kind`, `rule`, `source`, `stage` and `class` against their allowlists, `location` and the
ids against their patterns — rather than one pattern over all text. The stamps are the journal's:
a record that arrives with its own `schema`, `producer_seq`, `event_id`, `boot_id`, `wall` or
`mono_ns` is refused (`invalid_field` naming `schema`, `producer_seq`, `event_id`, `boot_id` or
`time`), not silently overwritten. `boot` and `transitions_lost` are written only by the journal
itself, `build_commit` only on `boot`, and `rule` is only `watchdog/1`. A refused record takes no
sequence number, so a hole in `producer_seq` is always an eviction.

| Identifier | Rule | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opaque id: `boot_id`, `build_commit`, `correlation` | `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$` — no `/`, `.`, `:`, space, so a path, URL or `Bearer x` header is rejected | `boot-7f3a`, `c9fe745db066`, `tr-01HZX3` |
| Location code | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z0-9_]+){0,7}$`, ≤ 96 chars — never a file path or line | `cloud.link.read_handler`, `cloud.transport.read_loop` |
| `event_id` | `<boot_id>-<producer_seq>`; unique per producer boot | `boot-7f3a-3` |
| `phase_id` | process-local counter; correlation only, never authority | `2` |

**Sources** (`source`): `daemon`, `cloud_api`, `relay`, `viewer`, `collector`.

**Stages** (`stage`, path order — `Lifecycle`): `client_issued`, `cloud_accepted`,
`relay_socket_accepted`, `relay_forwarded`, `frame_read`, `sender_verified`, `lane_queued`,
`handler_started`, `handler_completed`, `response_sealed`, `spool_queued`, `writer_lock_waiting`,
`socket_write_started`, `socket_write_ended`, `endpoint_received`, `endpoint_decrypted`,
`ui_applied`, `acknowledged`; plus `idle` for a long-lived loop between pieces of work.
`ui_applied` is a browser applying data; `acknowledged` is only a person's explicit action.

**Classes** (`class`, the only metric dimension): `read`, `control`, `status`, `transport`, `probe`.

**Kinds** (`kind`): `finite` has warn and block deadlines and can be blocked; `long_lived` has
neither and is reported `idle`, never blocked, for waiting for work.

**Watchdog states** (`state`): `progressing`, `slow` (≥ warn), `blocked` (≥ block with no
progress), `idle`, `unverified_after_gap` (crossed block in the first scan after the watchdog was
itself not scheduled; called blocked only if the next scan agrees).

**Journal events** (`event`): `boot`, `slow_detected`, `stall_detected`, `recovered` (new
progress after slow/blocked — silence is not recovery), `released_after_stall` (slot released;
the watchdog cannot see the outcome, so this is not success), `overflow`, `scheduling_gap`,
`clock_anomaly`, `transitions_lost` (`count` watchdog transitions were dropped just before this
record because the queue to the journal was full; the page holding it reads `partial`),
`state_after_loss` (written by the journal's writer right after each `transitions_lost`, once per
phase the latest report holds as `slow`, `blocked` or `unverified_after_gap`, with that `state`:
the dropped transition may have been the phase's `stall_detected`, and the watchdog never repeats a
transition, so without it a journal could read "loss, then quiet" while a handler is still stuck).
`state` appears on no other event, and no caller may append either of the writer's events.

**Outcome** and **quality** are design §5's: outcomes `healthy`, `slow`, `blocked`, `error`,
`offline`, `unknown`, `no_requests`; qualities `complete`, `partial`, `stale`, `not_collected`,
`unsupported`, `forbidden`, `no_requests`. `Classify` is the table; its tests pin that an open
socket with nothing completed is `no_requests`, a source with no receipt is
`unknown`/`not_collected`, and an open socket beside a blocked handler is `blocked`.

## 3. Lifecycle reading

`ProgressAlong(path, receipts, active, visible)` answers, for one logical operation:

- `last_proven_stage` — the end of the contiguous run of receipts from the start of the path;
  empty when the first stage has none.
- `active_stage` — set **only** from an independent active-phase span (a `Phase` in the table);
  `null` otherwise, never inferred.
- `next_unobserved_stage` — the first stage after the proven run without a receipt.
- `visibility_limit_at` — set when that stage's recorder is a source this scope may not read, so
  its absence says nothing.
- `later_receipts` — receipts past the hole: evidence, not proof the hole's stage happened.

## 4. Local evidence export v1 (implemented)

Produced by `Export(&report, journal, query)`. The block below is the exact output of
`ExampleExport` in `internal/domain/connectionhealth/example_test.go`, which the test suite pins:
a read handler that started 40 ms after being queued and then made no progress for 16 s, beside
an idle reader loop. Durations are nanoseconds of the producer's monotonic clock; `wall` is for
display and may jump.

### Coverage metadata

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `coverage.quality` | `complete`, or `partial` when records the query covers were evicted or the page holds a `transitions_lost` record |
| `first_retained_seq`, `last_seq` | the ring's retained range when read |
| `gap_from_seq`, `gap_to_seq` | the exact sequence numbers asked for and already evicted |
| `evicted_total`, `refused_total` | lifetime counts of evicted and refused records |
| `truncated`, `next_after_seq` | the page hit a bound; continue with `after_seq = next_after_seq` |
| `durability` | `memory_only_lost_on_restart` until the on-disk journal exists |
| `newest_age_ns` | freshness of the newest retained record |
| `watchdog.trace_coverage` | `partial` once any `Begin` was refused for want of a slot |
| `watchdog.overflow` | refused `Begin`s: total, critical, `by_class`, first and last monotonic offset |
| `watchdog.gap_ns`, `clock_backwards_ns` | the watchdog itself was late, or the clock went backwards |
| `watchdog.scan_seq` | scans so far; it advances even while the journal is held |
| `watchdog.transitions` | `complete`, `partial` once any transition was dropped before the journal, `not_collected` without a journal |
| `watchdog.transitions_lost_total`, `transitions_pending` | dropped transitions, and the queue's depth when the report was made (the example shows 2 because it reports before `Flush`) |

### 4.1 Wired call sites and the local route

Every daemon phase is `source: daemon` with the plan's 5 s / 15 s deadlines; each long-lived loop
holds one of the 8 reserved slots for its socket's life, so three are used per connected line.
Correlations are minted by the tracker (`op-<base36 counter>`), never taken from a frame, channel,
sender, session or document; `phase_id` is the attempt, the correlation the logical operation.

| Location | Stage(s) | Function | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cloud.transport.read_loop`, `keepalive_loop`, `drain_loop` | `idle` | `(*Transport).read`, `keepalive`, `drain` | long-lived, reserved |
| `cloud.transport.handle_frame` | `frame_read` | `(*Transport).handle` (and `AcceptDirect`) | finite, one per frame |
| `cloud.transport.settle_receipt` | `frame_read` | `(*Transport).handleFrame` (ack and publish-error settlement) | same phase, stepped |
| `cloud.transport.sender_lookup`, `signature_check` | `frame_read` | `(*Transport).admitTraced` | same phase, stepped |
| `cloud.transport.replay_claim`, `open_envelope` | `sender_verified` | `(*Transport).admitTraced` | same phase, stepped |
| `cloud.transport.inbound_callback`, `peer_callback` | `lane_queued` | `admitTraced`, `handleFrame` | same phase, stepped |
| `cloud.transport.drain_send` | `spool_queued` | `(*Transport).drainPass` (one per drain tick and per reconnect re-send) | finite |
| `cloud.websocket.writer_lock` → `socket_write` | `writer_lock_waiting` → `socket_write_started` → `socket_write_ended` | `(*Conn).writeFrame` | finite, one per frame written |
| `cloud.link.read_lane`, `command_lane`, `sessions_lane` | `lane_queued` | `(*Link).lanePhase` | finite, one per request |
| `cloud.link.read_handler`, `command_handler`, `sessions_handler` | `handler_started` → `handler_completed` | `(*Link).answerTraced` | same phase, stepped |
| `cloud.relay.reserve` → `seal` → `spool_seal` | `handler_completed` → `handler_completed` → `response_sealed` → `spool_queued` | `(*Relay).PublishTracked` | finite, one per answer, class `transport`, under the handler's correlation |
| `cloud.relay.direct_write` | `handler_completed` | `(*Relay).PublishTracked` | finite, one per direct answer; ends at the carrier's write and claims no spool or relay stage |

**One answer, one correlation.** `answerTraced` puts the handler's correlation on the context it
hands `Service.Answer` (`connectionhealth.WithCorrelation`; a nil tracker or no correlation leaves
the context untouched and allocates nothing). `Relay.PublishTracked` begins the answer's own phase
before the spool's lock (`cloud.relay.reserve`), steps it to `cloud.relay.seal` before sealing and to
`cloud.relay.spool_seal` (`response_sealed`) before taking the lock again to queue the bytes, and
ends it at `spool_queued`. The handler's own phase still ends only when `Answer` returns. The spool
keeps the correlation on the row (`Spool.SealCorrelated`), bounded by the row caps and dropped with
the row's bytes when it is acknowledged, refused, burned or coalesced, and gone when the row is
collected; it is never in the sealed envelope, the frame, or any wire field. The drain writes the
row with `Conn.WriteTextTraced`, and a reconnect re-send (`Spool.ResendCorrelated`) does the same:
each write is its own `writer_lock` → `socket_write` phase, with its own `phase_id`, under the one
correlation. Pings, closes, subscribes and untraced `WriteText` callers keep an uncorrelated phase.
The drain pass phase (`cloud.transport.drain_send`) covers many rows and stays uncorrelated.

Nothing here changes a deadline, a return value, an error or a retry; a nil tracker (monitoring
off, or a test or old caller that passes none) records nothing. A full table means a phase is not
recorded and the overflow is counted; the business call proceeds.

`GET /v1/connection-health/status` (latest report, journal coverage, wiring, report age; quality
`not_collected` before the first scan and `stale` when the report is more than three scans old),
`events?boot_id&after_seq&limit&since&until`, `trace?correlation=` (active findings and journal
records naming it) and `export` (§4 plus `locations`, the map above bound to `build_commit`). Only
this machine's own token reads them; a paired device or the machine token is refused, and a request
the Cloud line dispatched in process is refused `forbidden` even though it carries this machine's
token. The route reads atomics and the journal's lock; it never calls `Scan`, the relay, the
spool or a status snapshot. `clawdline health status|events|trace|export` reads it with the local
token (`--since/--until` as RFC 3339 or a duration back from now, `--after-seq`, `--limit`,
`--boot-id`, `--correlation`, `--json`); a daemon it cannot ask is reported unknown, exit 1.
`history?cursor&limit` (and `clawdline health history --cursor --limit`) pages the durable store
across boots; until the store is open it answers `unsupported` naming `opening` or the failure
code. `status` carries a `durable` block: `opening`, `open` with the store's `Status`, or `failed`
with its code.

### 4.2 Stall capture (implemented, on by default)

When a scan first calls a finite phase `blocked`, `Watchdog.transition` queues the
`stall_detected` record and then calls `Capturer.Request`, which takes one compare-and-swap and
one send on an empty channel. The scan never waits for the capture, the journal, a disk or the
network. The one worker (`Capturer.Run`, started by `Runtime.Run` and not joined at shutdown)
dumps every goroutine into its own reused 1 MiB buffer, sanitizes the dump, clears the raw bytes
and publishes an immutable `Capture` through an atomic pointer. The raw dump never leaves the
worker: it is not exported, not logged and not written to disk.

| Situation | What the caller sees |
| --- | --- |
| Capture off (`CLAWDLINE_STALL_CAPTURE=off`) | `state: "off"`, `skipped_off_total` counts each stall; the stall record stands |
| A capture in flight | the trigger is refused, `refused_busy_total` |
| More than 4 captures started in one minute | refused, `refused_rate_limited_total` |
| A capture running past 2 s | `state: "timed_out_unavailable"`, `timed_out_total` once; later triggers are refused as `refused_unavailable_total`; no second worker is ever started, because `runtime.Stack` cannot be cancelled |
| It finishes late | published with `over_budget: true`, `over_budget_total`; the worker takes triggers again |
| The sanitized capture fails the final allowlist check | not published, `rejected_total` |

The stall record, its `recovered` or `released_after_stall` record and the journal are written
by the watchdog's own writer whatever the capture does; a test holds the capture forever and
checks both are journaled and the export still answers.

**Sanitizing.** A goroutine header keeps its id, the runtime's wait-state words and its
`N minutes`; anything else in the header (labels, `gp=`/`m=` fields) is dropped. A function keeps
its name without the argument list only when it belongs to this module, the standard library
(first path element without a dot, or `main`) or a module this binary was built with
(`debug.ReadBuildInfo`); otherwise it is `<redacted>` and counted in `functions_redacted`. A file
becomes `file:line` relative to this module, the Go root or the module cache (for a listed module
only), without the `+0x` offset; anything else, any `..`, and the file of a redacted function is
dropped and counted in `source_unavailable`. A line the sanitizer does not recognise is dropped and
counted in `lines_unparsed`, never copied.

**Join.** `Capture.join` names the trigger's location code, the Go function the location map gives
it (`Locations`), how many goroutines hold that function and the exact `file:line` of each, read
from this build's own dump. Matching goroutines are listed first so trimming to 512 KiB keeps them.
`Runtime.Export` adds `stall_capture`:

`recovery.state` is `recovered`, `released_outcome_unknown`, `still_blocked` or `unknown`, read
from the journal and the latest report, never from the capture; `journal_quality` is `partial`
when the stall record itself is no longer in the ring. `GET /v1/connection-health/status` carries
the worker's status as `stall_capture`.

**Owner diagnostics.** The owner-sealed feed (`cmd/clawdline/health.go` `sealedFeed`) seals the
stall as revision 1 in `clawdline.health-owner-diagnostics/1`, unchanged. A published capture
and the stall's recovery are later revisions of the same attachment in
`clawdline.health-owner-diagnostics/2`, which adds `capture` (the join, the first matching
goroutine's frames, at most 24, and the counts) and `recovery`. /1 refuses either field, /2
requires one of them, an unknown version is refused, and both the Go and the TypeScript readers
check every frame against the same allowlist (`internal/adapters/healthsealed/testdata/snapshot-v2.json`
is the shared vector). Cloud stores only the ciphertext; no Cloud change is needed. The feed
remembers 32 stalls; a forgotten stall's capture is sealed from its own trigger and its recovery is
not sealed (the local export still has it).

**Measured cost** (`CLAWDLINE_CAPTURE_MEASURE=1 go test -run TestMeasureCaptureCost -v
./internal/domain/connectionhealth`, go1.27.1 darwin/arm64, 14 procs, 20 rounds, parked goroutines
12 frames deep; control is the same loop with capture off):

| Goroutines | Mode | p50 wall | CPU per capture | Allocs / bytes per capture | Worst lateness of a 200 µs ticker | Largest non-GC stop-the-world | Raw / sanitized |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | off | 250 ns | — (probe only, 0.67 ms) | 7 / 992 B | 0.11 ms | — | — |
| 100 | on | 5.7 ms | 7.6 ms | 1,212 / 1.5 MB | 1.07 ms | ≤ 1.3 ms | 369 KiB / 259 KiB |
| 1,000 | on | 17.4 ms | 21.9 ms | 2,843 / 5.7 MB | 5.8 ms | ≤ 6.3 ms | 1,024 KiB (full) / 489 KiB |
| 5,000 | on | 36.6 ms | 45.0 ms | 2,823 / 5.5 MB | 26.3 ms | ≤ 29.4 ms | 1,024 KiB (full) / 489 KiB |

A capture runs only after a phase has made no progress for 15 s, at most four a minute, so the
worst measured case costs at most about 120 ms of pauses a minute on a process with 5,000
goroutines, and about 5 ms with 100. That is why it is on by default. At 1,000 goroutines and above
the raw buffer fills and the capture says `raw_truncated`; the runtime prints the calling goroutine
first, so the dump still begins with the stack it was taken from but may miss the stalled one,
which `join.matched_goroutines: 0` then says. The owner page shows that as "unavailable" with the
evidence gap `capture_not_matched`, never as a clean capture and never as proof the goroutine was
not stuck.

**Target-first sampling was investigated and not adopted (2026-10-21).** A ten-line experiment
(go1.27.1 darwin/arm64, goroutines parked 12 frames deep plus one stalled in a distinct function
started last) compared `runtime.Stack(buf, true)` into the 1 MiB buffer with the supported
aggregated goroutine profile, `pprof.Lookup("goroutine").WriteTo(w, 1)`:

| Goroutines | `runtime.Stack` | holds the stalled one | aggregated profile | holds the stalled one |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1,000 | 1,024 KiB (full), 9.8 ms | no | 3.3 KB, 4.2 ms | yes |
| 5,000 | 1,024 KiB (full), 33.0 ms | no | 3.3 KB, 10.1 ms | yes |
| 20,000 | 1,024 KiB (full), 88.8 ms | no | 3.3 KB, 30.9 ms | yes |

The aggregated profile finds the stalled goroutine here only because the other stacks are
identical. It cannot be bounded by this worker: the runtime first collects one stack record per
goroutine (memory grows with the goroutine count, outside the raw buffer's bound), its output
grows with the number of distinct stacks, and it lists records by count, so a single stalled
stack sorts last and is the first thing a bounded writer would cut. It also carries no goroutine
state. Go offers no supported API to dump one chosen goroutine. So the 1 MiB raw and 512 KiB
sanitized caps, the one in-flight worker and the measurements above stay as they are, and a large
process keeps answering `raw_truncated` with `matched_goroutines: 0` honestly. Revisit if the
runtime gains a bounded per-goroutine or filtered stack API.

## 5. Typed failures

`CodeOf(err)` returns one of these; no failure is turned into an empty page.

| Code | When | Caller sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_field` | an enum, id or location fails its rule; `Error.Field` names it | the phase or record is not kept |
| `slots_exhausted` | no free slot | zero `Handle` (every call a no-op); the operation proceeds uninstrumented; counted |
| `record_too_large` | an encoded record over 1 KiB | not kept; `refused_total` +1 |
| `query_bound_exceeded` | `limit` < 0 or > 200 | no page |
| `cursor_other_boot` | `boot_id` in the query is not this journal's boot | no page: the sequence numbers it names do not exist (HTTP 409) |
| `invalid_cursor` | `after_seq` past the newest sequence this boot assigned, or not a number that fits one (the largest `uint64` included) | no page; HTTP 400 |
| `unsupported` | export asked of a missing watchdog report or journal; monitoring off | no export — never a quiet-looking empty one (HTTP 503 before the first scan, 501 when off) |
| `forbidden` | the local route asked through the Cloud line | HTTP 403 |
| `unsupported_schema`, `idempotency_conflict` | reserved for the ingest and query routes below | — |

## 6. Bounds

All are proposals from the plan, registered in `internal/domain/capacity` and lowerable by
`CLAWDLINE_NEXT_CAPACITY`. `TestEveryBoundIsRegistered` was red on all seven constants before the
rows were added, and on `MaxPendingTransitions` and its channel before the eighth.

| Row | Limit | At the limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cloud.health_active_slots` | 128 rows | refuse `Begin`, count by class and interval, coverage partial |
| `cloud.health_reserved_slots` | 8 rows (of the 128) | refuse critical `Begin`, counted as critical |
| `cloud.health_journal_rows` | 4,096 records | evict oldest, count, name the gap |
| `cloud.health_journal_bytes` | 4 MiB | evict oldest, count, name the gap |
| `cloud.health_record_bytes` | 1 KiB per record | refuse, count |
| `cloud.health_pending_transitions` | 256 transitions queued for the journal writer | drop the transition, count it, report `transitions: partial`, journal `transitions_lost` |
| `cloud.health_query_rows` | 200 per page | stop, `truncated`, cursor |
| `cloud.health_query_bytes` | 1 MiB per page | stop, `truncated`, cursor |

Parameters, not capacities: watchdog cadence `DefaultCadence` 1 s; finite deadlines are per
`Spec` (the plan's proposed 5 s / 15 s); scheduling gap is a scan later than 2 × cadence;
`ErrorRateThreshold` 1 %.

### Measured cost

`go test -run '^$' -bench . -benchtime 2s -benchmem ./internal/domain/connectionhealth` on an
Apple M4 Pro, 14 threads, 2026-10-20, rerun after the queued journal writer and the `End` retry:

| Benchmark | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Begin` + `Progress` + `End`, parallel | 298.3 ns/op, 416 B/op, 2 allocs/op (before: 298.6 ns/op) |
| One `Scan` of 120 active phases, journal attached, no transitions | 26.9 µs/op, 121.3 KB/op, 24 allocs/op (before: 22.4 µs/op, 102.6 KB/op, 22 allocs/op; the difference is the copy of the findings published for `Latest`) |

The call sites, on and off (nil tracker), `go test -run '^$' -bench 'WriteFrame|HandleFrame'
-benchtime 2s -count 3 -benchmem ./internal/adapters/cloud` and `-bench IdleScan` in this package,
same machine, 2026-10-20 (three runs each, middle value):

| Benchmark | Off | On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WriteFrame`: one masked text write to a discarding socket | 106 ns/op, 96 B, 2 allocs | 1008 ns/op, 720 B, 5 allocs |
| `HandleFrame`: one peer frame through `handle` to its callback | 204 ns/op, 16 B, 1 alloc | 1194 ns/op, 449 B, 5 allocs |
| `IdleScan`: one scan of an idle line (three loops held), paid once a second | — | 956 ns/op, 3.5 KB, 11 allocs |

So instrumentation adds about 0.9–1.0 µs and three to four allocations to each frame read or
written, most of it clock reads and the immutable phase copy each step makes; the idle watchdog
costs about 1 µs per second. Not measured: daemon CPU under real relay traffic, a scan under load
or with queued transitions, memory of a full ring.

## 7. Concurrency

- `Tracker`: each slot is an `atomic.Bool` claim and an `atomic.Pointer[Phase]` to an immutable
  snapshot. `Progress` swaps in a copy with CAS; `End` clears it only if it still holds its own
  phase, retrying when a concurrent `Progress` replaced the snapshot, so it never leaves a slot
  claimed; a second `End`, or a stale handle after the slot was reused, finds another phase or
  none and does nothing. Nothing blocks. (`TestEndThatRacesProgressStillReleasesTheSlot` puts a
  `Progress` between `End`'s read and its swap; it failed on the single-CAS `End`.)
- `Watchdog.Scan` is called from one goroutine (`Run`, whose lifetime is its context). It reads
  only the tracker's atomics and its clock, and takes no lock: each transition goes into a
  256-row queue with a non-blocking send, a full queue drops and counts it, and the report is
  published with an atomic store for `Latest`. `Run` accepts no caller callback.
- One journal writer goroutine, started and joined by `Run`, is the only code that waits on the
  journal. It appends each transition with the scan's own instant and writes `transitions_lost`
  exactly where drops happened. A journal held forever stops the writer and delays `Run`'s
  return until it is released, never a scan (`TestAScanNeverWaitsForAHeldJournal`,
  `TestRunAdvancesWhileTheJournalIsHeldAndLeavesNothingRunning`; both failed with the old
  synchronous append). `Flush` drains the queue on the caller's goroutine for a caller without
  `Run`.
- `Journal` has its own mutex, held for a copy and one `json.Marshal` of a ≤ 1 KiB record, or for
  one page read. No business code holds it, and it does no I/O.
- `Export` takes the watchdog's latest report rather than calling `Scan` itself, so the watchdog
  stays single-owner.

## 8. Permission classification

Classes the Cloud/owner routes must enforce per field. Superuser never receives owner-private
classes.

| Class | Fields | Cloud operator | Account owner (own machine) | This viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service metadata | `schema`, `rule`, `source`, `stage`, `class`, `kind`, `event`, `state`, outcome, quality, coverage counts, freshness, bounds | yes | yes | own viewer source only |
| Machine identity | `boot_id`, `build_commit`, presence, last snapshot age | yes (opaque machine id) | yes | no |
| Correlation | `correlation`, `phase_id`, `event_id`, `producer_seq` | yes, as opaque ids; no cross-tenant lookup by guessing | yes | own traces only |
| Owner diagnostics | `location`, `age_ns`, `deadline_ns`, overflow `by_class`, watchdog findings | **no** — aggregate counts only | yes | no |
| Owner diagnostics: sanitized stall capture | `stall_capture` (§4.2): allowlisted function names, module-, Go-root- or dependency-relative `file:line`, wait state, counts | **no** — sealed for the owner only | yes | no |
| Never exported | payloads, paths, URLs, tokens, session or document names, SDP/ICE addresses, raw goroutine dumps, function arguments, addresses, absolute paths | no | no | no |

An item the scope cannot read stays as `{ "source": "<source>", "forbidden": true }` with no body.

## 9. Upload, ingest and query — proposal, not implemented

Aligned with the Cloud plan's proposed v1 so the root can unify them. Field names in the Go
records (`producer_seq`, `event_id`, `boot_id`, `build_commit`) are already the ones below.

**Batch** (`POST /v1/health/ingest`, machine credential over a dedicated HTTPS client, separate
from the relay socket and its writer lock; tenant and machine come from the principal, never the
body):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "batch_id": "boot-7f3a-b0001",
  "producer_instance": "daemon",
  "boot_id": "boot-7f3a",
  "events": [
    {
      "schema": "clawdline.connection-health.record/1",
      "producer_seq": 3,
      "event_id": "boot-7f3a-3",
      "boot_id": "boot-7f3a",
      "event": "stall_detected",
      "wall": "2026-10-20T12:00:15.04Z",
      "mono_ns": 15040000000,
      "source": "daemon",
      "stage": "handler_started",
      "class": "read",
      "kind": "finite",
      "location": "cloud.link.read_handler",
      "phase_id": 2,
      "correlation": "tr-01HZX3",
      "age_ns": 15000000000,
      "deadline_ns": 15000000000,
      "count": 1,
      "rule": "watchdog/1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Bounds: 32 KiB per batch; 1 MiB per machine per hour with a reserved 64 KiB and 120 metadata
requests per hour for heartbeats, transitions and loss markers; one batch in flight.

**Receipt** (only after the store committed):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "receipt_id": "rcpt-01HZX4",
  "batch_id": "boot-7f3a-b0001",
  "digest": "sha256-<canonical batch digest>",
  "persisted_at": "2026-10-20T12:00:17Z",
  "accepted": 1,
  "rejected": [],
  "coverage": { "first_seq": 3, "last_seq": 3 }
}
```

**Idempotency.** `(tenant, source, boot_id, batch_id)` and `(tenant, source, boot_id, event_id)`
are unique. An exact retry returns the original durable receipt without rewriting it; the same id
with a different canonical digest is `409 idempotency_conflict`; a retry past the dedupe window is
`receipt_expired`, never silently re-accepted. Authority is rechecked on every retry. A producer
that lost the answer resends the same batch — it never mints new ids, and never resends a user
mutation.

**Rejections and failures:** malformed batch → whole batch `400 invalid_field` /
`unsupported_schema`; a valid batch with an unsupported event → indexed `rejected[]` with its
code; quota or store failure → no receipt (not persisted); scope in the body that disagrees with
the principal → `403 forbidden`.

**Query envelope** (operator `/su/v1/health/...`, owner `/v1/health/...`):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-10-20T12:01:00Z",
  "as_of": "2026-10-20T12:00:59Z",
  "outcome": "blocked",
  "evidence_quality": "partial",
  "sources": [
    { "source": "daemon", "boot_id": "boot-7f3a", "build_commit": "c9fe745db066",
      "freshness": "fresh", "last_receipt_age_ms": 12000, "expected_every_ms": 30000 },
    { "source": "viewer", "freshness": "no_receipt" }
  ],
  "coverage": { "seq_ranges": [{ "boot_id": "boot-7f3a", "from": 1, "to": 3 }], "gaps": [],
                "retention_floor": "2026-10-19T12:01:00Z", "dropped": 0, "truncated": false },
  "clock_uncertainty_ms": 250,
  "rule_version": "watchdog/1",
  "events": [],
  "next_cursor": null,
  "partial_reason": "viewer_not_collected"
}
```

Bounds: 200 events or 1 MiB per page, 5 s total deadline, raw range ≤ 24 h (wider windows use
minute aggregates). The cursor is bound to scope, filter and window. Stored queries never contact
the machine, relay or account handler. A source with no data is `not_collected` or `unsupported`,
never an empty success; a `null` duration is never drawn as zero.

## 9a. Daemon uploader (implemented)

`internal/adapters/healthupload` posts the durable store's records to Cloud's
`POST <cloud_api_base>/v1/health/ingest` (Cloud contract §2) and nothing else.

**Turning it on.** All three, read from local files on every cycle (30 s), so turning any of them
off stops the next request without a restart:

```json
// <state dir>/config.json; the default state dir is ~/.config/clawdline-next
{ "cloud_enabled": true, "cloud_health_upload": true }
```

`clawdline cloud on` sets `cloud_enabled`. The upload switch is
`clawdline setting set cloud_health_upload on` (and `off`; `get` reads it, absent reads `off`),
written through `/v1/settings` with this machine's local token only — a paired browser cannot
change it. It must be JSON `true`; anything else is off, and nothing turns it on by default.
The machine must also be enrolled. The identity is the machine's
own (`machine-identity-v1.json`), and its `api_base` must equal the settings' `cloud_api_base`
(`adaptercloud.CheckEnvironment`), else `origin_refused`. The base must be `https://`; plain
`http://` to loopback is accepted only when `Options.AllowLoopbackHTTP` is set, which the daemon
never does. Off states make no request at all: `not_opted_in`, `cloud_off`, `no_identity`,
`identity_unreadable`, `origin_refused`, `source_not_open`.

**Wire.** One batch per request, one boot per batch: `schema_version: 1`, `batch_id`
`s<first_seq>-<last_seq>`, `producer_instance: "daemon"`, `boot_id`, `build_commit` from the
store's boot header, `events[]` of record/1. Each event is copied through a fixed struct
(`wireEvent`) with exactly Cloud's keys: `schema, producer_seq, event_id, boot_id, event, wall
(UTC), mono_ns, build_commit, source, stage, class, kind, phase_id, correlation, count, rule,
state`. `location`, `age_ns` and `deadline_ns` have no field there, so they cannot leave. `state`
is set only on `state_after_loss`, the one event where Cloud requires it (`slow`, `blocked` or
`unverified_after_gap`) and refuses it everywhere else. The location codes `sender_lookup`,
`signature_check`, `replay_claim` and `open_envelope` are locations, not stages, and are never
sent in any field.
`sent_at` is omitted on purpose: it is part of Cloud's batch digest, and a batch rebuilt from the
same records after a lost progress file must replay (200), not conflict (409). Cloud therefore
reports `clock_offset_ms: null` for this producer. The bearer is the machine credential in the
`Authorization` header only; redirects are not followed and there is no cookie jar.

**Not sent, counted instead** (`totals.excluded` by reason): a `state_after_loss` whose state is
not one of Cloud's three (`state_unsupported_by_cloud`), an event or stage Cloud does not list, a source other than `daemon`, `mono_ns` or any integer above 2^53−1, an id
or rule that fails Cloud's pattern, and a single record that alone would exceed the body bound.
Durable-store loss markers (`loss` entries) have no producer sequence and cannot be record/1
events; they are counted as `storage_loss_records`, and store gaps by reason as `store_gaps`. Both
stay visible locally only — **wire gap for Cloud**: Cloud has no field for producer-side storage
loss yet. A batch-envelope `local_loss` counter is a proposal awaiting its own receiver; until it is
built the uploader sends none and invents no record to carry the counts, so Cloud reports such a
gap as unexplained. A progress file written before this change may still hold the retired reason
`state_after_loss_unsupported_by_cloud` in its cumulative totals.

**Delivery and retries.** One batch in flight. Its exact body is written to
`<state>/connection-health/upload/upload-state.json` (atomic replace, fsync) before the first
attempt, and each attempt is counted there before it is made. Only a parsed receipt naming this
`batch_id` moves the cursor as delivered (`receipted_events`; `duplicate_events` for Cloud's
`duplicate_event`); a 2xx without one is retried. Committed (the store's fsync), sent, and
receipted are separate counters; nothing here says a person saw anything.

| Cloud answers | The uploader |
| --- | --- |
| 201 / 200 with a receipt for the batch | moves the cursor; keeps the newest 16 receipts |
| network error, timeout (10 s per attempt), 5xx, 2xx without receipt | same body, same `batch_id`, backoff 5 s doubling to 5 min |
| 429 | waits `Retry-After` (≤ 1 h), then the same body |
| 401 / 403 | `auth_refused`; that credential is not used again until the identity changes; the batch waits |
| 400, 409, 413, other 4xx | the batch is counted as refused with Cloud's code and field (never its message) and not resent |
| 6 attempts or 1 h without a receipt | abandoned and counted (`abandoned_events`; Cloud may or may not hold it) |

**Budgets.** At most 120 requests and 960 KiB (1 MiB less Cloud's 64 KiB metadata reserve) per
clock hour, every attempt counted, persisted across restarts; at the bound `quota_local` until the
next hour. Batches are at most 100 events and 32 KiB (a 512 B margin is kept). Idle (nothing new
in the store) is one local identity read and one store page read per 30 s and **no request**
(`TestARestartResendsThePendingBatchAndKeepsTheCursor`). Measured on an Apple M4 Pro: building and
encoding one 97-event, 31.8 KB batch from a 200-entry page costs 206 µs and 333 KB allocated; an
idle cycle 18.5 µs and 35 KB (`go test -bench . ./internal/adapters/healthupload`). At the
hourly cap that is about 25 ms of CPU per hour. Production network cost is not measured.

**Status.** `GET /v1/connection-health/status` carries `upload`: `state`, `last_error`,
`last_refusal {http, code, field}`, `pending {batch_id, events, bytes, attempts, next_attempt,
persisted: no|unknown}`, `hour`, `totals`, `last_receipt`, `receipts_kept`, `state_bytes` (the progress file's size as last read or written, `null` before it is read; it feeds the `cloud.health_upload_state_bytes` capacity row); `clawdline health
status` prints one line of it. Capacity rows `cloud.health_upload_*` measure the hour's spending,
the pending batch and the receipts. Status is a copy under the uploader's own lock: an unreachable
Cloud never makes it, the local query or any business path wait.

**Independence.** The uploader's import graph contains no Cloud line package
(`TestTheUploaderDoesNotDependOnTheCloudLine`): its own `http.Transport` (one connection, 5 s
dial/TLS), its own goroutine, no relay socket, writer lock, spool or lane.

**Not done.** Owner-sealed diagnostics (encryption is the next separate capability; until then the
private fields stay on this machine and no remote investigation is complete); Cloud fields for
storage loss and `state_after_loss`; heartbeat/presence; uploading on a schedule tighter than 30 s.

## 9b. Owner-sealed diagnostic clients (implemented, not wired to a live key)

The private Cloud contract §13 defines the wire. This repository holds both clients:

- Go: `internal/adapters/healthsealed`. `DeriveKey` is HKDF-SHA256 (32 zero-byte salt, info
  `clawdline/health-sealed/v1`), `AAD` is the 13-field canonical JSON, `Seal`/`Open` are
  AES-256-GCM. The plaintext is `clawdline.health-owner-diagnostics/1` (`Snapshot`): a whitelist of
  location, `age_ns`, `deadline_ns`, build, stage, correlation id, observation time, coverage, and
  `truncated`/`lost`. Int64 values are decimal strings; a value that could not be read is `null`,
  never `0`. Each revision's exact body is written atomically to the pending store before the first
  send, so a retry, including one after a restart, sends identical bytes; the receipt's
  `aad_sha256` must equal the client's own or the upload counts as failed. The worker takes
  snapshots through a non-blocking `Offer` (queue 8; full answers `busy`), and a full store
  answers `store_full` at once. A snapshot that arrives while an earlier revision of the same
  attachment is still pending (held request, lost receipt, spent attempts) is sealed at once as
  the next revision, chained to the pending one's fixed ciphertext digest, and queued behind it in
  the same on-disk record; the pending bytes are never rewritten, so Cloud never sees a changed
  body for a revision. `Send` delivers the queue in revision order after each receipt, and a
  restart resumes it from disk. The queue is bounded by `MaxRevisions` (8) and the store bounds;
  a snapshot past them is not written and is counted in `dropped` with its code
  (`revisions_exhausted`, `store_full`, `too_large`, `sealed_expired`). A permanent refusal of
  a pending revision refuses every revision chained after it (`predecessor_refused`) without
  sending them; after a content-key rotation queued material is refused locally (`wrong_epoch`)
  and never sent; with the opt-in off nothing is sent and the queue waits until the attachment
  expires and is pruned. Every bound is in `capacity/register_healthsealed.go`.
- PWA: `web/console/src/cloud/health-owner`. It lists `GET /v1/health/sealed`, signs a
  `clawdline.health-sealed-read/1` proof with the registered device key, posts it to
  `POST /v1/health/sealed/read`, and opens the revision only after the AAD, its digest, tenant,
  machine, attachment, revision, epoch, expiry and ciphertext digest all match. Decrypted snapshots
  are held in memory only; a generation counter, bumped on sign-out, account or epoch change,
  keeps a stale fetch or decrypt from repopulating the cache. The panel is the Diagnostics tab of
  the paired machine view, outside `AdminGate`.
- The opt-in is `cloud_health_owner_retention`, off by default and independent of
  `cloud_health_upload`. Off writes nothing and makes no request.

Both sides pin the §13.7 synthetic vector in `internal/adapters/healthsealed/testdata/vector.json`.

**Why nothing can be sealed or opened yet.** No content-key epoch is recorded anywhere in the
product, and the PWA keeps the master secret only as a non-extractable AES-GCM `CryptoKey`
(`legacy/js/net/cloud-crypto.js` `importMasterSecret`), which cannot seed HKDF. Both clients
therefore answer `key_handover_required` rather than guess. Closing it needs the pairing handover
to also keep an HKDF import of the master secret together with its content-key epoch, the device
and identity epochs to be known to the client, and the content-key grant contract. The daemon
does not yet construct the uploader (`cmd/clawdline/health.go`).

**The content-key grant (Cloud §13.9) is not signed by this daemon.** Cloud records a grant only
when the machine's `confirm` on `POST /v1/pairing/identity/phases/confirm` carries a
`handover_attestation`, which the machine may sign only after the viewer's `activate` proved it
holds the master secret of that content-key epoch. This daemon pairs through
`/v1/pairing/invitations/start`, `/poll` and `/v1/pairing/complete`
(`internal/adapters/cloud/pairing.go`), has no identity-phase client, and no viewer sends a key
confirmation in `activate`. Signing without that proof would record a grant Cloud cannot tell
from a true one, so no attestation is sent. Until then a sealed read answers
`403 key_handover_required`, which the panel shows as "pair this device again" and never retries.


## 10. Remaining wiring, in order

1. Done: one runtime per boot, real capacity measures (§1).
2. Done for a handler's answer (§4.1): one correlation from the frame through the lane, handler,
   reservation, seal, spool row and each socket write and re-send. Still uncorrelated: answers
   published outside a handler (status snapshots, terminal frames, carrier answers) and refusals
   sent by `refuseBusy`.
3. Done: local route and CLI (§4.1).
4. Done: durable store opened and fed (`docs/admin-connection-health-storage.md`), and flushed and
   closed at daemon shutdown.
5. Done: the daemon uploader (§9a) and the stall capture worker (§4.2). Next: Cloud fields for
   storage loss and `state_after_loss` and full real-source acceptance of M01–M06 remain pending. Owner sealing is
   now wired into daemon startup; loss counters use separate immutable metadata-only batches.
6. Done, off by default: the browser viewer producer (§11), hosted-page lifecycle behind
   `VITE_VIEWER_HEALTH=on` (§11.4), and relay write observation. Still pending: direct-carrier
   observation. Stream gaps remain unsupported until a trustworthy sequence contract exists.

## 11. Browser viewer producer (implemented, off by default)

The signed-in hosted console's own evidence: how this page's relay connection, reads and
decryption went, sent as `clawdline.viewer-health.record/1` to Cloud's `POST
/v1/health/viewer-ingest` (Cloud contract §14). Its value is that it does not travel on the relay
it reports on: when the relay socket is down the page still uploads over its own HTTPS `fetch`
with the session cookie (`credentials: "include"`, header `x-clawdline-health: viewer/1`).

### 11.1 Wire

Every enum, pattern and limit is the Cloud parser's (`record.ts`): eight stages, three events,
five outcomes, thirteen error words, the five classes. A record carries only `schema`,
`producer_seq`, `event_id` (`<boot_id>-<seq>`), `boot_id`, `event`, `wall`, `mono_ns`, `stage` and
optionally `class`, `correlation`, `outcome`, `elapsed_ms`, `error`, `count`. `boot_id` (`pg-` + 16
hex) is generated at producer start; each logical attempt gets a fresh random `correlation`
(`vt-` + 12 hex). Neither is derived from a URL, channel, Session, document, message or request id,
and no hook site passes one: the hook API (`viewer-health-hook.js`) takes a stage, a class and an
error word only. An observation the Cloud would refuse (an error word on a non-failed event, an
unknown stage, a non-opaque correlation) is dropped and counted locally (`refusedLocally`), never
sent to cost the batch a 400. `elapsed_ms` and `count` are clamped to the Cloud's ceilings.

### 11.2 Wired sites

| Stage | Where | Events |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `viewer_connect` | `cloud-boot.js` `keepConnected` loop, the loop's first `session.connect()` | started; completed `ok`, failed with the classified error, or completed `aborted` (stopped, pairing, device seat) |
| `viewer_reconnect` | the same loop, every later attempt while no client serves | as above |
| `viewer_carrier_replace` | the same loop, an attempt while a ready client still serves (token renewal, fresh socket after a long hide) | as above |
| `viewer_sse_resume` | `cloud-client.js` `start` → `_becameReady` of a client created with `resumeFrom` | completed `ok` when the predecessor's delivery provably continued (`_continueFrom` taken); failed `sse_resume_refused` when continuity was unproven and rows are asked for again; failed `carrier_closed` if the socket closed first |
| `viewer_request_issued` | `cloud-client.js` `_read`, when the read's waiter is created | started |
| `viewer_response_received` | `cloud-client.js` `_settleRead` | completed `ok`; failed `timeout`, `carrier_closed`, …; an abandoned read is failed `unclassified` with outcome `aborted` |
| `viewer_request_issued` (class `control`) | `cloud-client.js` `_publishAcknowledged` (a write that resolves on the relay's ack: an answer to a Mac without `cloud_status.v >= 1`) | started |
| `viewer_response_received` (class `control`) | the same write, when it settles | completed `ok` on the relay's ack; completed `pending` when the ack timer ran out and the write resolved having heard nothing; failed with the classified word on a relay refusal (`machine_offline`, `publish_error`) or a seal failure |
| `viewer_decrypt_apply` | `_settleRead` success (an answer is only settled opened and applied), and `_receiveEnvelope`'s failure path | completed `ok` under the read's correlation; failed `replay_rejected`, `apply_failed` (probe stage `apply`) or `decrypt_failed` (anything before the payload opened), under its own correlation |
| `viewer_carrier_replace` (class `transport`) | `direct-carrier.ts` `negotiate`: one WebRTC carrier attempt, the direct path taking reads over from the relay | started; completed `ok` when the channel opened; completed `aborted` on the machine's `terminal_busy`; failed with `directCarrierHealthError` (`terminal_direct_ice_failed` → `network_unreachable`, `terminal_direct_chunk_timeout` → `timeout`, a closed or never-opened channel → `carrier_closed`, an answer or envelope that would not open → `decrypt_failed`, anything else through `classifyViewerError`) |
| `viewer_carrier_replace` (class `transport`) | `direct-carrier.ts` `lost`: an **open** carrier that stopped carrying | failed, with its own correlation; a deliberate close (`carrier_client_retired`, `carrier_client_stopped`, `carrier_replaced`) records nothing |
| `viewer_request_issued` / `viewer_response_received` / `viewer_decrypt_apply` (class `read`) | `status-client.js` `_readOnCarrier`: a read written to the open carrier | the same trace as a relay read, settled by `_settleRead`: a carrier that takes the request and never answers is failed `timeout`, not silence behind an open relay socket |
| `viewer_carrier_replace` (class `read`) | `status-client.js` `_relayAfterCarrier`: the carrier gave a read up and the relay takes it over | failed (`carrier_closed`, or the publish failure's word) under the **read's** correlation, before the relay's answer settles the read |
| `viewer_decrypt_apply` (class `read`) | `status-client.js` `receiveCarrierEnvelope` failure path | failed with the relay path's words, under its own correlation |

"SSE" in the Cloud's stage names is mapped onto the relay WebSocket the hosted console actually
uses: the hosted console has no EventSource; its stream resume is the successor socket taking over
from its predecessor. Error words come from `classifyViewerError`: a fixed table of the
transport's own codes, anything else `unclassified`, never a guess.

### 11.3 Not wired (stated, not hidden)

- `viewer_sse_gap`: the relay socket has no contiguous per-stream ids for the page to detect a
  skipped range (sequences are per sender across channels), so no record is ever sent. A Cloud
  reader showing no gap rows has **no** evidence that none happened.
- **The Cloud wire has no carrier dimension.** The direct carrier is recorded under
  `viewer_carrier_replace` (a carrier taking reads over is a carrier replacement), class
  `transport`, beside the relay's successor sockets: a Cloud reader cannot tell the two apart from
  the record, and the correlation is random (`vt-`) for both. Splitting them needs a carrier field
  or stage in Cloud's §14 parser; until then the direct carrier's failures are visible but mixed
  into that one stage's rates, and never into `viewer_connect`.
- A terminal's own negotiation is now recorded by `terminal-transport.ts` `prepareDirect`;
  ownership of later loss observation transfers to the carrier on adoption, without a duplicate.
- No gap is derived from carrier sequences: they are per peer channel, and a copied `s/` row keeps
  the relay sender's number, so neither is a contiguous stream id.
- `_publishAcknowledged` (inspected for this list): every settle is recorded once — the relay's
  ack, its refusal, a seal or publish failure, and the ack timer (`pending`). A retired client hands
  the write to its successor, which records it; one that rejects before a successor exists records
  nothing, because nothing was issued.
- Writes that resolve from the Mac's own result (send, dispatch, and an answer to a Mac with
  `cloud_status.v >= 1`) go through `_read` and are recorded as reads (class `read`), not as
  `control`.
- A decrypt or apply failure of an envelope cannot be tied to the read it answered (the read id is
  inside the ciphertext), so it carries its own correlation; the read then shows as a failed
  response (usually `timeout`) under the read's correlation.
- The local console's same-origin daemon and its SSE streams are not Cloud viewers; nothing there
  records.

### 11.4 Turning it on

Two explicit conditions, both required; nothing is collected otherwise.

1. **The build.** `VIEWER_HEALTH_BUILD_FLAG` (`lifecycle.ts`) is true only when the hosted console
   was built with `VITE_VIEWER_HEALTH=on`. Unset, empty or any other value is off, so every
   existing deployment records nothing until a build is made with the flag on purpose. There is no
   runtime, account or URL switch that turns it on.
2. **The page.** `ViewerHealthLifecycle.update({ apiOrigin, signedIn, account, targetMachineId })`
   runs the page's one producer only while the transport is the Cloud and the page is signed in to
   an account. `CloudGate.tsx` calls it as that state changes: another account stops the old
   producer and starts a fresh one (no buffer crosses accounts); a change of `targetMachineId` (the
   owned Cloud `machines` id the page is reading) calls `setTargetMachine` without a restart;
   sign-out, revocation (`stop("session_gone")`), leaving the Cloud and unmounting call `stop()`,
   which clears the buffer and pending batch, aborts the request in flight, and uninstalls.

`startViewerHealth({ enabled: true, apiOrigin, targetMachineId? })` (`install.ts`) remains the one
entry the lifecycle uses; any other configuration answers `null` and records nothing.

### 11.5 Bounds and failure behavior

Rows `console.viewer_health_*` (`register_viewer_health.go`, held to `VIEWER_HEALTH_LIMITS` by
`TestViewerHealthBoundsMatchTheProducer`): body 16 KiB, 50 records per batch, 200 buffered (oldest
dropped and counted), one batch per 60 s at most after a 5 s coalesce, 60 requests and 256 KiB per
clock hour (retries included; at the bound nothing is sent until the hour turns), 4 tries with
5/20/60 s backoff and `Retry-After` honored up to an hour, 10 s per request. One worker: one
timer and at most one request in flight per page.

| Cloud answer | Producer |
| --- | --- |
| 201, 200 (identical replay) | batch done |
| network error, timeout, 429, 5xx (except below) | same body bytes, same `batch_id`, after backoff; dropped and counted after the 4th try |
| 401 | stop and clear: `session_gone` until a new session starts a new producer |
| 403, 503 `health_ingest_disabled` | stop and clear until reload |
| 404 `machine_not_found` | the same records go again with no `target_machine_id` (a new identity, so a new `batch_id`) |
| 413 | split: records back to the buffer front, later batches cut to half |
| 409, 400, other 4xx | batch dropped and counted; only status, `code` and `details.field` are kept |

Records arriving while a batch waits for its retry go to the next batch; the retried body is the
frozen string, never rebuilt. A stop increments a generation so a late answer changes nothing. A
hook or producer exception is swallowed at the hook; the page's connect, read and apply paths
never await the producer.

### 11.6 Measured cost

`node --experimental-strip-types` over the real `viewerRecord`: a typical record is 297 bytes, a
worst-case one 407; 50 typical records are 15,122 bytes (under 16 KiB), 50 worst-case 20,622, so the
body bound cuts those at ~39. Page memory: at most 200 × 407 ≈ 80 KB of records plus one 16 KiB
pending body. Network: at most 256 KiB per hour per page by the hourly bound. Cloud retention is
the Cloud's: 24 h, 4 MiB per device; revoking the device stops new uploads but stored rows stay
until their retention ends (Cloud §14.4). Not measured: real-browser CPU per record, and Cloud
index overhead of viewer rows.
