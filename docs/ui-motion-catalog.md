# UI motion catalog

For maintainers and reviewers selecting motion changes, this register gives each interaction a stable identifier so feedback keeps the same subject across releases. It records proposals, not authorization to implement them.

## Identity and evidence

The source audit is pinned to `85d42421ec8e0968290b15515b1d9c11cf60927e` (2026-10-20). Two read-only audits covered Session interactions and global pages. The root checked the navigation drawer's final stylesheet order: `main.tsx` imports `sidebar-scroll.css` after `legacy/pages.css`; historical comments in the latter do not describe the current cascade.

Do not renumber or reuse IDs. The next unused ID is AN-032. Keep an old localized name as an alias when renaming; use child IDs when splitting a scope. The Taiwan Traditional Chinese names below are the exact feedback labels issued to the person.

AN-001 through AN-023 were cataloged as proposals or improvements. The first approved batch is recorded below; the remaining proposals still require selection. AN-024 through AN-031 describe existing behavior and are retained for feedback. Screenshots in the companion review artifact use production React components and CSS with synthetic data; they locate targets and do not prove animation quality, authenticated Cloud flows, or full acceptance.

## First approved batch

AN-001, AN-002, AN-003, AN-004, AN-009 and AN-014 are implemented for review. Production deployment requires separate approval; the earlier HTML atlas remains a pre-implementation target map.

The Session action menu, composer suggestions and Project picker retain only a non-interactive closing picture through discrete display transitions. Hidden content is inert immediately. Unsupported engines keep immediate controls. More commands keeps its existing level slide and observes reduced motion.

The native to-do disclosure measures its body only on a toggle and animates height and padding for 220 ms. Its summary's requested expanded state and the body's inert state change immediately; native content remains open only until the closing picture finishes. Rapid reversal cancels the old animation after reading its current height. Data refreshes do not restart it. Attention Notes use a reversible grid transition; secret fields still unmount immediately on close, nested details retain their prior reset behavior, and secret completion does not acquire a second exit transition. Composer selection state still clears immediately; only the last displayed suggestion rows survive for the exit picture.

Chromium and WebKit passed at 390px and 1280px with synthetic data: open/close, intermediate heights, reversal, keyboard focus, nested controls, secret-field clearing, suggestion filtering and reduced motion. Disabling the new stylesheet made menu opening immediate (opacity 1); enabling it produced intermediate opacity. In one recorded run at 390px the to-do disclosure closed from 258.56px through 106.53px to 38.39px in Chromium, and from 257px through 107.58px to 38px in WebKit. These runs verify the production components locally and do not claim authenticated Cloud acceptance.

## Acceptance before implementation

Animate explicit person actions, not every token, poll, retained snapshot or status update. Closing immediately removes hit testing and keyboard access; focus returns to the appropriate trigger. Rapid toggles reverse cleanly. Reduced motion switches immediately. Sending, interrupting and ending never wait for decoration. Do not scale text or move the whole transcript. Validate phone WebKit and desktop Chromium, keyboard navigation, long content and updates during reversal.

The first proposed batch is AN-001, AN-002, AN-003, AN-004, AN-009 and AN-014. Tool output, diffs, trees and variable-length content need scroll and layout-cost checks. AN-013 and AN-023 are deferred because the reading and lifecycle costs currently exceed the expected benefit; this is a recommendation, not removal from scope.

Do not add token-by-token entrances, terminal-output animations, rolling metric numbers, continuous bounce, or another transform on elements already controlled by card movement or use feedback.
