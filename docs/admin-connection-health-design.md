# Connection health: panel design

Status: design proposal with a standalone prototype
([`admin-connection-health-preview.html`](admin-connection-health-preview.html)) that draws all six
screens, M01–M06. Nothing here is
shipped console behaviour. Every threshold below is a **proposal, not a measurement**; every number
in the prototype is an illustrative fixture.

## 1. What the page is for

An operator, or an account owner looking at their own machine, opens the page because something
feels slow or stuck. Within one screen they must see:

1. **Whether requests are blocked, slow or failing right now**, and since when.
2. **Where on the path** (browser, relay, machine receive / process / send, collector).
3. **How much of that we can actually see** — evidence quality, per source, with its age.

Then they go overview → incident → request trace → agent evidence, ending with a structured record
a future agent can use to find the code. The page is read-only: no restart, retry, repair or
setting change appears anywhere on it.

It is not a log viewer and not a wall of green uptime tiles. Healthy is quiet grey; only a block,
slowness, an error, an offline machine or an unknown stretch draws the eye.

## 2. What was inspected

| Piece | Where | What this design takes from it |
|---|---|---|
| Admin shell: sidebar on desktop, drawer on phone | `web/console/src/cloud/admin/admin.css:82-184`, `AdminGate.tsx:303`, `:379-403` The existing admin has five routes (overview, survey, accounts, usage, promotions); connection health is a separate group of screens added after them in the same shell. |
| Palette and its reason for being dark only | `web/console/src/legacy/tokens.css:1-29` | Same tokens; no light theme (see §11). |
| Text-contrast rule | `admin.css:1-5` | `--faint` and `--bad` never colour words, only bars and outlines. |
| Tiles, panels, tables, phone card tables | `admin.css:343-413`, `:480-496`; `AdminDashboard.tsx:312` (`Tile`) | Tiles row, panels, table → card-per-row below 560 px. |
| Stale and demo treatments | `AdminGate.tsx:197-211`, `admin.css:141-149`, `:437-441` | A refresh failure keeps dated figures; demo is labelled and inert. |
| Unknown is a word, not a zero | `AdminDashboard.tsx:296-299`, `admin.css:424` | Empty latency is "Unknown", never 0 ms. |
| Browser-only direct history | `web/console/src/cloud/direct-history.ts:1-16`, `:100-108` | A browser's record speaks for that browser only; idle hours are not failures. |
| Machine road and offline wording | `web/console/src/pages/devices/AccountMachines.tsx:67-85` | Offline / relay / direct / failing roads; owner sheet is the owner boundary. |
| Machine Cloud status snapshot | `internal/adapters/cloud/status.go:28-55`, `:95` | Counters and drop reasons the machine already keeps. |
| Relay inbound queue bound (64 rows, refuse) | `internal/domain/capacity/register_cloud.go:170-180`, `internal/transport/cloud/relay.go:123` | The queue tile uses the registered limit, not a new one. |
| Staged truth vocabulary | `docs/cloud-request-architecture-v2.md:95-96`, `:469-500`; `docs/cloud-error-transparency.md:100-116` | Waterfall stages are separate receipts. |
| Bounded diagnostics with completeness | `docs/diagnostics.md:81-100`, `:184-212` | Evidence states what was dropped and how complete it is. |

The root's integration plan (screen IDs M01–M06, the two-dimension health rule, presence-based
offline, probe semantics) is the governing spec; this document only designs the panels for it.

## 3. Information architecture

Stable screen IDs, used in review and future feedback:

| ID | Screen | In the prototype |
|---|---|---|
| M01 | Connection health | `#overview` — verdict, tiles, freshness, timeline, incidents, segment table. |
| M02 | Machine connections | `#machines` — presence, boot/build/platform, presence and carrier timeline, viewers and carriers, replacement chain, oldest holders by stage, freshness, correlated incidents. |
| M03 | Cloud services | `#services` — components with build/instance/outcome/quality/impact, component timeline, relay stages, dependency waits, saturation, correlated incidents. |
| M04 | Request trace | `#trace/<incident>` — waterfall or table of one correlated request. |
| M05 | Incident investigation | `#incident/<incident>` — facts / suspected / missing, waterfall, code locations. |
| M06 | Monitoring status | `#monitoring` — per-source freshness, gaps, drops, retention, read-only probe. |
| — | Agent evidence | `#evidence/<incident>` — structured JSON with copy and download. |

Navigation: the sidebar keeps the five existing admin routes and adds a *Connection health* group
with M01, M02, M03 and M06. M01 verdict → *Open incident* → M05 → *Request trace* (M04) → *Agent
evidence*. The verdict links to M02, M03 and M06; the segment table's machine rows link to M02 and
its relay and collector rows to M03. M02 and M03 each end in a correlated-incidents panel that
routes to M05, M04, the evidence and M06. M05 links back to the screen of its segment. A
breadcrumb on every inner page returns to M01.

### Desktop (≥ 900 px)

```
[ prototype label — sticky, always visible                                   ]
[ sidebar ][ fixture · scope · window · Live/Pause                           ]
[         ][ VERDICT: outcome + evidence quality + since + Open incident     ]
[         ][ incident | inbound queue | error rate | latency p50/p95/p99 + n  ]
[         ][ freshness by source (4 cards)                                   ]
[         ][ shared timeline: 6 lanes, incident band + marker buttons        ]
[         ][ incidents in window        ][ health by segment (table)         ]
```

### Phone (360 px)

Sidebar becomes a drawer behind a 44 px menu button. Tiles go two by two. Each timeline lane puts
its name *above* the track so the track keeps the full width; the page never scrolls sideways.
Tables become one card per row (the campaigns pattern, `admin.css:480-489`). The waterfall puts
the stage name and time on one line and the bar on the next. Controls wrap.

## 4. Components

Each row: purpose · data · actions · empty / loading / error / unknown.

**Prototype label.** Always on screen, sticky, accent background, localized
("設計原型 · 示意資料 · 非即時監控" / "Design prototype · illustrative data · not live
monitoring"). Holds the language toggle. In production the same strip is the *example mode*
label and appears on every view and every export.

**Controls.** Scope (Cloud service / Your machine / This viewer), window (15 min / 1 h / 6 h),
Live / Pause. Live means the window's end follows the clock and source ages keep counting; paused
freezes the window and every age and says how many receipts would have arrived since. A live
refresh never moves keyboard focus, scroll position or the selected incident. Changing scenario
(fixture only) resets the window to 1 h and the selection to that scenario's newest active
incident, and says so; a deep link to an incident that is not in the new scenario falls back to
M01 with a notice. Loading: controls stay usable; the body shows the admin skeleton
(`admin.css:443-448`). Error: see the verdict.

**Verdict.** The first thing read. Two separate answers: **outcome** (healthy, slow, blocked,
error, offline, unknown) and **evidence quality** (complete, partial, stale, not collected,
unsupported, not permitted, no requests). Plus the newest active incident, *since HH:MM UTC (N
ago)*, and *Open incident*. A blocked verdict has an accent frame; unknown has a dashed frame, so
"we cannot see" never looks like "fine". Loading: skeleton. Load failure with prior data: keep the
old verdict, dated, with the stale notice (`AdminGate.tsx:208-211`). First-load failure: no verdict
at all, the typed failure code — never a green guess.

**Tiles.** A line under the tiles and the segment table states that these figures are a fixed
60-minute fixture window with its end time; the time-window control changes timelines and event
lists, not them. Latest active incident; machine inbound queue (rows used of the registered 64, meter,
oldest waiting age, and its as-of time when the machine is offline); error rate with its
denominator; latency p50 with p95, p99 and sample count. Below 20 samples p99 is replaced by "too
few samples (n)". Empty latency is "Unknown", never 0 ms. In a scope that cannot read owner data
the queue tile says so instead of showing a number.

**Freshness by source.** One card per source: this viewer, relay metrics, machine status snapshot,
telemetry collector. Each states fresh / stale / no receipt / not reported / not visible, the age
of the last receipt, the expected cadence, and how long it is kept. There is no single global
"connected" badge.

**Shared timeline.** One lane per segment over the selected window: browser, relay, machine
receive, machine process, machine send, collector. States are drawn by **height and pattern**, not
colour alone: healthy is a thin grey line; slow is a medium band; blocked is the tallest accent
bar; errors are a striped band; offline is a hollow capsule; unknown is diagonal hatching across
the whole track; not retained is a dotted line with words; not visible in this scope is an empty
track with the words. Point events (connection close, refusal start, reconnects) are thin ticks.
The incident interval is a shaded band across every lane; its marker is a real button (`■
INC-S1`) that opens M05. Each track has an `aria-label` that reads the lane as a sentence. *Show as
table* swaps in the same data as a table.

**Incidents in window.** Rows with glyph, title, id, active/resolved, interval, cause certainty and
an *Open* button. Empty: "No incident was opened in this window."

**Health by segment.** Table: segment, outcome, evidence quality, p50, p95, p99, samples, errors,
source age. Unknown cells say "Unknown"; forbidden rows show "—" with the quality "Not permitted".

**Incident (M05).** Header with severity and a certainty badge (cause confirmed / suspected /
unknown). A facts list (id, start, end or ongoing, segment, trace, build). Three separate columns:
**observed facts** (each with its source), **suspected cause** (with its basis: a source, a fixture
declaration or "inference"), **missing evidence**. A suspected cause built only from ordering says
so in its own words. Then the waterfall and code locations.

**Waterfall / request trace (M04).** Eight stages, each a separate receipt: accepted, queued,
executed, published, relay delivered, viewer received, **UI adopted** (the viewer applied the state
to the screen) and **explicitly acknowledged** (a person's own action, only for operations that ask
for it; otherwise "Not requested by this operation"). UI adoption is never called acknowledgement.
An executed stage with no completion receipt but an independent active-phase span reads "active
handler span … open for …" instead of "No receipt"; a stage recorded by a source the scope cannot
read reads "Not visible in this scope" with no time. A stage with no receipt is a
dashed empty bar reading "No receipt" — it is never assumed to have happened. A late stage is warn
coloured **and** carries ▲. The axis is logarithmic so a 40 ms queue and a 61 s receipt are both
visible; times are printed, so the scale never has to be read. Table alternative: stage, offset,
delta from previous, recorder, receipt age.

**Example responsibility points.** Each entry is a stage location code, optionally a repository
path, line and symbol, and one line saying what that code does today. The panel says plainly that
these are hypothetical instrumentation points, not the exact build of a real incident, and that the
stable stage-to-source map is not implemented; a location code without a path names no line. A
listed line is never presented as the root cause: in INC-S1 `(*Relay).start` is shown only as the
place that creates the bounded inbound channel. Public repository paths only; a private service is
a location code with no path.

**Monitoring status (M06).** Per-source table: freshness, age, gaps in window, dropped records,
schema version, retention. Then the **read-only probe** panel: a synthetic read issued from this
viewer, every 60 s, at most one outstanding. It lists each edge it exercised and its result, and
lists *command execution* as "Not exercised: unverified". It is excluded from user success/error
denominators and "proves this viewer's viewpoint only".

**Machine connections (M02).** Facts: fictional machine id, presence (renewed N ago, or expired N
ago), presence contract (proposal), boot id and time, build, platform, last status snapshot age.
A timeline with four rows — authenticated presence, relay socket, this viewer's direct path, status
snapshots — that follows the window and has the table alternative. *Viewers and carriers*: one row
per viewer (fictional ids) with the read carrier, the command/status carrier, state, connection
generation, last seen, replaced and refused counts; a direct close leaves only the direct carrier
unavailable. *Replacement attempts and refusals*: events inside the window, newest six, each with
its generation change and close or refusal reason, or "not reported by this build". *Oldest active
holder, by stage*: handler, inbound queue, publish, send, with holder, age, the proposed 5 s / 15 s
deadline and last progress; an offline or silent machine shows them as of the last snapshot.
Then the freshness strip and correlated incidents.

**Cloud services (M03).** Components (Cloud API, relay Worker edge, account execution, telemetry
ingest, telemetry query) with outcome, evidence quality, fictional build and instance, source age
and impact. A component timeline. *Relay path, stage by stage*: admission → account entry → handler
return → edge completion, each with p50, p95, samples, pending and oldest pending. A standing
notice: a completed socket write proves only that bytes left Cloud, never that a viewer observed
them. *Dependency waits* (account storage, API database, service fetch, socket write) and
*saturation* (admission slots, an illustrative bound, and oldest pending). Then correlated incidents
and a route to M06.

**Agent evidence.** Pretty-printed JSON and two real local actions: *Copy JSON*
(`navigator.clipboard`; on refusal the text is selected and the person is told to press ⌘C/Ctrl+C)
and *Download .json* (a Blob generated in the page). Both status messages say the content is
generated from the fixture; there is no "captured diagnostics" message anywhere. The record gives
`stage_progress` as `last_proven_stage` (end of the contiguous run of receipts), `active_stage`
(only from an independent active-phase span, otherwise null) and `next_unobserved_stage`, plus
`visibility_limit_at` when the scope hides the next stage. It obeys the scope like the page: an
item the scope cannot read stays as `{source, forbidden: true}` with no text. A fixture's injection
manifest is exported separately as `fixture_ground_truth` with `observed: false`.

## 5. Health truth table

Outcome, decided per segment and then for the visible path (worst wins, in this order):

| Outcome | Evidence required (proposal) | Glyph | Must stay distinct from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blocked | An identified in-flight stage exceeds its no-progress deadline (proposal: oldest pending > 30 s with zero completions in that stage). | ■ | A full queue alone, which is saturation. |
| Offline | The machine's authenticated presence contract at the relay expired (proposal: 90 s without renewal). | ○ | A direct-path close, which marks only that path unavailable; sleep, power and network causes are never inferred. |
| Error | Attributed typed failures for a named stage (proposal: ≥ 1 % of a window's logical operations). | ✕ | A successful relay fallback after a direct failure. |
| Slow | Valid-window p95 above the operation's target with ≥ 20 samples (proposal targets from `cloud-request-architecture-v2.md` §9). | ▲ | Timeouts, which are counted as errors and shown separately. |
| Unknown | Evidence missing, stale, contradictory or unsupported. | ? | Healthy. A gap is never filled with zero or the previous green. |
| No requests | A fresh source saw nothing to do. | – | Missing data. |
| Healthy | Fresh observations and recent completed work within target. | ✓ | Socket-open, which proves only the transport. |

Evidence quality, separately: `complete`, `partial` (gaps inside the window), `stale` (source
stopped; values shown with their as-of time), `not_collected` (no receipt at all), `unsupported`
(this build does not emit it), `forbidden` (this scope may not read it), `no_requests`.

Recovery requires new success or progress evidence; errors merely stopping leaves recovery
unverified.

## 6. Freshness and retention wording

A source is **fresh** while its last receipt is within twice its expected cadence (proposal), then
**stale**. A source that never reported in the window is **no receipt**. Wording on screen:
"Last receipt 12 s ago · expected every 15 s" and "Kept for 24 h".

Cadences and retention follow the root technical plan's proposed defaults, all pending pressure
tests: active-source snapshots (machine status, relay metrics) every 30 s; collector upload flush
at most 15 s; dashboard polling every 15 s; probe every 60 s with one outstanding. Retention: Cloud
routine detail 24 h, incident evidence 7 d, minute aggregates 30 d; machine local detail 7 d or
100 MiB, whichever comes first; the viewer's own record 24 h of hourly counts (as
`direct-history.ts` keeps today). When a byte cap is reached first the page shows the actual floor
(the reconnect-storm fixture: 4 h). Beyond retention the timeline says **Not retained**, which is
not unknown and not healthy, and a selected window that reaches past retention has evidence
quality **partial**, never complete.

## 7. Permission boundaries

| Scope | Who | Reads | Never reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cloud service | Strict superuser (the admin gate's API decision, `AdminGate.tsx:16-25`) | Relay metadata, presence, collector health, anonymous aggregates | Owner machine detail; any decrypted content. Superuser cannot decrypt a machine's data. |
| Your machine | Account owner on a paired device | Its own machine snapshot and this viewer's record, plus the Cloud-side rows for that machine | Other accounts. |
| This viewer | Any signed-in viewer | This browser's own attempts and probe | Anything else. |

The operator's own machine may compose Cloud and owner rows only when both authorizations are held
separately; linking from Devices never grants superuser rights. A lane the scope may not read says
"Not visible in this scope" and its quality is "Not permitted" — it is not unknown and not empty.
An offline machine still shows every Cloud-side observation (presence expiry, refusals,
`machine_offline` counts) and its last snapshot with an as-of time.

The scope is applied to every item by the source that recorded it, not only to timeline lanes:
incident facts, suspected causes, missing evidence, trace stages, code locations, the M02 viewer
table and replacement chain, the M03 builds, waits and saturation, and the evidence export. A hidden
item leaves a "Not visible in this scope" marker with a count and no body. Presence is visible in
every scope; an inference is shown only in the scope that reads all of its inputs; the fixture
ground truth names owner internals and is shown only in the owner-inclusive scope.

## 8. Critical journeys (each is a fixture in the prototype)

1. **Handler stalled, socket open.** Verdict *blocked*, queue 64/64, oldest waiting 18 min. Relay
   lane is slow (forwarded, no reply) while its socket is open; machine process lane is the tall
   accent bar. M05: the observed conclusion is that the handler does not return — a queued receipt,
   an active handler span (synthetic, with an injection id) past its deadline and no execute
   receipt — and its certainty stays **suspected** because nothing shows *why*. The fixture's
   injection manifest (lease held, never returns) is a separate, labelled *ground truth* panel the
   conclusion does not rely on. M02 shows the presence and socket healthy while the handler holder
   is 18 min old; M03 shows account execution returning in milliseconds while edge completion
   times out.
2. **Relay receipt delayed.** Verdict *slow*, quality *partial* (a 6-minute relay gap). Execution
   and publish succeeded in 0.3 s; *relay delivered* is late (▲, 61 s). Cause **suspected** and
   the page says the suspicion rests on ordering only; three items of missing evidence are listed.
3. **Monitoring source unavailable.** Verdict *unknown*, quality *stale*; machine lanes hatched for
   22 minutes, while the relay still reports traffic. Nothing turns green.
4. **Machine offline.** Verdict *offline* in every scope, from presence expiry. A direct close two
   minutes earlier is shown as a tick on the browser lane and explained as path-only.
5. **Reconnect storm.** 47 reconnects in 9 minutes, now recovered; close reasons *unsupported* by
   this build, so quality stays partial and the cause stays suspected.
6. **Healthy.** Quiet page; the browser lane shows *no requests* before a viewer opened.

## 9. Accessibility

Contrast measured with the WCAG formula against `--card` (#16161a): `--ink` 14.5:1, `--dim`
6.2:1, `--accent` 5.8:1, `--warn` 5.7:1, `--adm-link` 8.5:1; `--faint` 3.4:1 and `--bad` 3.4:1
are used only for outlines, stripes and bars (≥ 3:1 non-text). Severity is always a glyph plus a
word. Every control is a native button, link, select or radio with the admin focus ring
(`admin.css:70-73`); touch targets are ≥ 32 px (incident markers) and ≥ 38–44 px elsewhere. Route
changes move focus to the page heading. Escape closes the drawer. Reduced motion removes the
drawer animation.

## 10. Integration notes for the root's technical plan

- Route: `/admin/health` with subroutes per M-screen; restore window, scope and selected incident
  from opaque ids in the URL; unauthorized deep links return a typed refusal with no data flash.
- Strings: the prototype's `WORDS` dictionary maps one-to-one onto `cloud/admin/words.ts` keys
  (English and Taiwan Traditional Chinese together, as the admin catalogue already does).
- Components to reuse rather than copy: `Tile`, `adm-panel`, `adm-table` with the phone card
  pattern, `adm-stale`, `adm-demo-control`, `adm-skeleton`. New: lane track, waterfall row,
  severity glyph, quality chip. The lane colours `--lane-ok` and `--lane-unknown` are new
  admin-local tokens (dark only, like the rest).
- **Diagnostics must stay readable when the failing relay is unusable.** M06 and the machine's own
  snapshot (`cloud-status`, `status.go`) are read through a path that does not depend on the relay
  being healthy; when that path also fails, the page shows the failed query, this viewer's probe
  viewpoint and the last confirmed data with its as-of time.
- **Monitoring is bounded.** Stage events go out in bounded batches with registered limits in
  `internal/domain/capacity`; at the limit the oldest is dropped and counted, and the drop count is
  shown in M06. It never becomes a second unbounded queue in front of the relay, and it introduces
  no paid service dependency.
- The dashboard is passive: no alerts by default, no commands, no automatic retry of a user
  mutation from an incident or a lost receipt.
- The evidence JSON shape (`clawdline.connection-evidence/0.1-draft`) is a starting point for the
  agent query contract, not a frozen schema.

## 11. Proposals left to the person

- **Light theme.** The console is dark only on purpose (`tokens.css:1-5`); this page follows it.
  A light admin would be a product-wide change, not this page's.
- **New lane tokens** (`--lane-ok`, `--lane-unknown`) in the admin palette. Cost: two tokens in
  `admin.css`; no other screen is affected.
- **A stable stage-to-source map.** Until it exists, code locations stay location codes with
  hypothetical paths. Cost: a registered table of stage codes owned beside the instrumentation.

## 12. Not verified

- No browser was opened by the tasks that drew this prototype. The prototype was syntax-checked and
  every route (M01–M06 and evidence) was rendered in a DOM stub for each scenario × scope × window ×
  live/paused × chart/table × language (2,808 renders, no `undefined`, `NaN`, raw key or unfilled
  placeholder; no forbidden item carrying text in a Cloud or viewer-scope export). Visual QA at
  desktop and 360 px, focus order and screen-reader output are left to the root.
- Overview tiles, segment figures and M03 stage statistics are a fixed 60-minute fixture window;
  they say so on screen and do not follow the window control. Timelines, incident lists and the M02
  replacement chain do.
- All thresholds, cadences, retention periods and bounds (including M03's 128 admission slots) are
  proposals or illustrations; none were measured. All machine, viewer, build and instance
  identifiers are fictional.
