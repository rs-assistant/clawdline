// The capacity register on this daemon (docs/limits.md §4, design-decisions
// D27): a beat that measures every registered row, `/v1/diagnostics.capacity`
// with the whole reading, and `/v1/health` saying `capacity_exhausted` — the
// reason only, never a name or a number — when an evidence or security-audit
// row is full with nothing making room.
//
// Both routes read what the last pass saw. A read measures nothing and writes
// nothing: the transitions and notices a reading causes are events in the
// store, and a GET that wrote them would be a read with a write's effect. The
// pass runs at start and on the scheduler's tick; `beat.at` says how old the
// reading is, and a beat that stops turns health red within three ticks, as
// the broker's does.
//
// A notice about a row whose register line tells a person by notice owes a
// push (C4). The `capacity.notify` event and that push are recorded in one
// transaction — the outbox's, so the broker that runs every other effect runs
// this one, and a daemon that dies between the commit and the push leaves a
// row the next one settles exactly once. The push is sent after the pass, off
// the beat, so a push service having a slow afternoon never makes the reading
// late. Its budget is the tracker's one notice per row a day, read back from
// the store when the beat starts so that a restart does not spend it again,
// and it is counted apart from everything the agents' notifications spend.

// capacityPushDeadline bounds one pass's pushes, retries and all, like the
// dead letter's.
