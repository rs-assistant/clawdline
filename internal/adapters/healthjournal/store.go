// Package healthjournal is the durable, segmented on-disk journal behind the
// connection-health evidence foundation (internal/domain/connectionhealth;
// design docs/admin-connection-health.md "Storage, retention and budgets";
// this package's contract docs/admin-connection-health-storage.md).
//
// The foundation's in-memory ring is lost on restart and says so. This store
// keeps copies of the records that ring already stamped, in its own directory,
// so a later boot can still page through what an earlier one saw. It is built
// so that the store can never slow the thing it observes:
//
//   - Offer never waits. It validates the record, takes the store's own short
//     admission lock and either queues the record or refuses it with a typed
//     code. A refused record is counted and later written as a loss marker.
//   - One worker goroutine, started by Open and joined by Close, owns every
//     write, fsync and deletion. Nothing else touches the active segment.
//   - Readers copy the segment list and open their own file handles; they hold
//     no lock the worker or a producer needs, and only MaxConcurrentReads of
//     them run at once — the next is refused, not queued.
//   - Admission is not durability. Offer's receipt says "admitted to memory";
//     Commitment and Flush say when a ticket was written and when it was
//     fsynced, and a ticket lost to a disk failure says lost.
